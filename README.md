# Fullstack Project — Next.js + Express

This project is a **fullstack application** developed using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend.

The development process included the use of **Replit’s AI** as a **support and experimentation tool**, intentionally applied to explore its capabilities in a real development scenario.  
Despite this assistance, **the majority of the architecture, technical decisions, business logic, and implementation were developed manually by me**.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project was twofold:

1. **Build a functional and well-structured application** using modern JavaScript technologies.
2. **Critically evaluate the use of AI as a development aid**, understanding where it adds value and where human reasoning and validation are essential.

The result is a solid application and valuable learnings, both technical and procedural.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Next.js**
- React
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- REST API consumption

### Backend
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- REST API
- Custom middleware
- Layered architecture

### Tools & Support
- Replit AI (used as an auxiliary and experimental tool)
- Git / GitHub

---

## Architecture & Technical Decisions

- Clear separation between **frontend and backend**
- API structured following REST best practices
- Code organization focused on **maintainability and clarity**
- Manual review and refactoring of AI-assisted code
- Technical decisions aimed at ensuring:
  - readability
  - logical correctness
  - architectural consistency

---

## Use of Artificial Intelligence

AI was used as:
- support for initial code generation
- assistance with repetitive tasks
- a learning and experimentation tool

However:
- no critical logic was used without manual validation
- several sections were rewritten, adapted, or discarded
- final decisions were always human-driven

This project reflects the belief that **AI should be treated as a development aid, not a replacement for technical understanding**.
